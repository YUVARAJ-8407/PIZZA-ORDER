?? Pizza Order Program (Python)This is a simple Python console-based application that calculates the total cost of a pizza order based on user preferences.The program allows users to select the pizza size (Small, Medium, or Large), choose whether to add pepperoni, and optionally include extra cheese.Input validation is handled to ensure only valid choices are accepted, preventing incorrect orders.The final bill is calculated dynamically using dictionaries for pricing, making the code clean and easy to extend.This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates core Python concepts such as conditional statements, dictionaries, and user input handling.
